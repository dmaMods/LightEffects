Note 1: If you want to make changes to the above vehicles in the Assets Editor, temporarily disable this mod because the beacon lights are not visible in the Assets Editor.

Note 2: The lights are based on the rotating snow plow lights so you need the Snowfall DLC.

Note 3: If you want another vehicle to be supported by this mod, please let me know and I will add the vehicle.
